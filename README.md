# Uno-X for Kleiner Perkins Fellowship
Uno-X is a modified version of Uno that I built for the KPCB fellowship coding challenge. The game rules are very similar to Uno in that we always try and play a card which matches the card on the board, and that we still have the ability to change the color using a change color card, or a +4 change color card which both changes the color and forces the adjacent opponent to pick up 4 cards. Following from Uno we also have the +2 color card, which can only be played on a matching color card from the top of the stack, but gives +2 cards to the adjacent opponent. The main difference from Uno that I ommited were the reverse,skip, and the ability of matching through numbers to change the color of the top of the board. I did those because I found the game more engaging if I increased the distribution of absolute change colors in the game(+4 or just change color) and in the 2 player version of the game(I optimized this for), a skip can be TOO powerful and a reverse does nothing. This game is meant so that every person playing the game swaps and looks at the terminal when its their turn and to ensure no cheating, I clear the terminal right after a turn is finished. I thought about doing something more complicated like hashing a password chosen by the users with their hand, but this felt uneccesary, people having fun playing Uno shouldn't have to cheat :). 

Code Configuration
> Everything is built in Python3 and the code hierarchy is structured in that there is a main Game class which controls almost all of the user experience. The Game class tracks the Player Objects who are partcipating. The other object class to keep in mind are the "Card" objects which are stored in a list for the players who possess them as well as being stored in the "deck" of the game and the "stack" of cards that we're adding cards to as we play.

Running the Game
The game is easy to play and only requires you to run the following to start it: 
`python3 game.py -numplayers 2 -decksize 52 -handsize 7` which just specifices the number of players, the decksize you wish and how large each intial handsize should be. Note that I am playing with the default colors used in Uno, so please use "red", "green", "yellow","blue" when asked by the program to pick what color you would like to use. Also for the convenience of the user, when picking a card to play from their hand, they pick the appropriate card using a zero index method, note you can also just look at the number printed next to the card in the list and that would be what you enter in. I.e [(card0,0),(card10,1)] if you wanted to play card1 you'd enter 1. Finally the most fun part of the game is when people reach Uno, the probabilty of you successfully tapping Uno depends on how many players are playing the game as you'll only successfully be able to avoid the others forcing the Uno penalty on you with probability 1/N. This is done through random generation as we don't have multiple keyboard inputs :(. The cards are generated through a weighted probability distribution that you can configure if you wish, but I found in my experience the current configuration is nice for well balanced game play, and for games that don't end up taking forever. The datastructures used are mostly hashmaps and lists, the stack of cards is clearly reprsented with a stack and the deck is represented as a list. We do however use a hashmap to track how much of each color a player has, so that we can quickly calculate whether he needs to draw cards. Another nice feature about this game is that we draw cards for you automatically so you do not need to look at your cards and figure this out, and yes the program is smart enough to figure out a change color card works if you don't have any of the actual color specified on the board.

Edge Cases
I accounted for most edge cases, I.e if you give the program bad input it'll quit gracefully saying you provided a bad input, or if you give me a deck that is less in size than the num_players*intial_size of hand I'm also going to throw an error. I didn't account for the fact that if you provide no arguements to the program that it won't work, but thats just a bit silly as you're not using the program as intended!

Cool Features:
While there are several cool features including the automatic deck drawing, another nice one is the ability for when the deck is exhausted for it to use the same cards from the stack on the "table" and reshuffle these except the last one and use this again as the deck. It makes the experience nice and more like the Uno you play at home :). Shuffling algorithim is implemented using pythons native shuffler, so I can't really take credit for coming up with the actual shuffling logic.

External Libraries
We only use python packages, of random to generate random numbers which is unavoidable in a nondetermnistic card game as well as using OS package to clear the screen after turns, and finally using the argparse package to properly take in command line arguements to run our game nicely for the client.

Code Organization
The code is extremely modular and neatly organized, into the Game,Card, and Player classes which all method lengths nice and short, as well as a python linter score of 6.82, which is very close to a 7 which is considered excellent!
